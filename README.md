# School-Absences
This is a C project, that reads from a file the full name of the students, the number of the times they were absent 
and the name of the area where their home is. 

After that, a new file is created with the full name of the students &amp; 
the number of the times they were absent, if the number is bigger than 100. Beneath that, ia the number of the students 
and underneath that is the number of the students with absences > 100.
